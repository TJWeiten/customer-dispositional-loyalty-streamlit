# Customer Dispositional Loyalty â€” Streamlit Companion Website

### Abstract

Despite the importance of customer loyalty and considerable research attention accorded to it, 
findings concerning the origins of loyalty are inconsistent. 
We reason that loyalty stems from not only firm-specific antecedents, 
but also a customer-specific trait that we name **dispositional loyalty**. 

In our research project, we not only define dispositional loyalty, 
but also develop and validate a scale for its measurement.

In conceptualizing dispositional loyalty, we extend the discipline's knowledge of brand loyalty. 
Unlike the attitudinal and behavioral dimensions of loyalty, which are specific to a firm/brand, 
dispositional loyalty is generalizable across consumption domains 
and can be useful for market research and consulting firms in segmenting markets.

We present this accomanying website to provide a brief overview of our research project 
and to allow you to take the scale we developed to measure dispositional loyalty.
